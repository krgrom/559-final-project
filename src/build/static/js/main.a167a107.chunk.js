Today we're going to be talking about the fastest way to\n            learn React. While I was head-down flexboxin\u2019 and gridding\u2019 and Sassing\u2019 and componetizin\u2019, the JavaScript community was promisin\u2019, lettin\u2019, =>\u2019in, and creating a whole bunch of other jazz. Because React and ES6 are very much intertwined, I have a hard time digesting any given block of code. What\u2019s coming from React? What\u2019s just ES6 JavaScript? It\u2019s hard to unpack multiple things at once, like trying to read a restaurant menu in a country that has significantly different cuisine and uses a totally different language. It\u2019s a lot to process.","In a popular course, you create a \u201cfish\u201d component, which immediately limits what kind of content can be poured into that component. I tend to create fairly dumb, reusable components (i.e. media-block, card, hero, etc) and keep specific business logic, content, and context away from that file to help ensure components can be portable and versatile. I know this is possible in React, but again I just haven\u2019t really come across any projects that I feel set things up in this manner. I\u2019d love to see projects that feature a library of dumb, abstract components, which then are consumed by more application-specific components.","I immediately bought as many JavaScript books as I could, and then crammed like I\u2019ve never crammed before on my flight.

While learning to code, you might also be confused at where does JavaScript end, and where Node.js begins, and vice versa. I would recommend you to have a good grasp of the main JavaScript concepts before diving into Node.js.","Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language. Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application. Despite the fact that it's always JavaScript, there are some key differences that make the experience radically different.","From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language. You have a huge opportunity because we know how hard it is to fully, deeply learn a programming language, and by using the same language to perform all your work on the web - both on the client and on the server, you're in a unique position of advantage."]},{name:"my-thoughts-on-resumes",title:"My Thoughts on Resumes",content:["Today is the day I talk about something which scares most people: resumes.

Think of your resume not as a comprehensive list of your career history, but as a marketing document selling you as the perfect person for the job.
